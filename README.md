# 🏛️ InfyBite (Ex-InfyByte)

> **Disclaimer:** Yes, the repo name says `infybyte`. No, I'm not changing it. Consider the 'y' a vintage design choice from the first 5 minutes of the project's life. It's not a typo; it's *heritage*.

**Infybite** is a high-performance, enterprise-grade catering management ecosystem. Built for the grand scale of VVIP Indian hospitality.

## 🏗️ The Tech Stack

This project is built with a "No Compromise" philosophy on speed and security:

* **Frontend:** React.js + Tailwind CSS
* **State Management:** Redux Toolkit (RTK) for predictable data flow.
* **Backend:** Go (Golang) using the **Gin Gonic** framework for lightning-fast API responses.
* **Real-time:** WebSockets integration for live status and price updates.
* **Database:** MongoDB with **GORM** (Go ORM) for flexible yet structured data handling.
* **Auth:** Secure Cookie-based sessions with Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).

## 🔐 Advanced Role-Based Access (RBAC)

The system is strictly partitioned into four distinct authority levels to ensure operational integrity:

| Role | Responsibility |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Admin** | Full system oversight, and and master data control. |
| **Manager** | For Managing Food Courts Assigned to them by their Vendors |
| **Vendor** | Creaetd by Admins, can create Managers to manage the track and status updates of items |
| **User/Client** | Menu selection and real-time menu tracking |

## ✨ Key Features
